## Description

This repo combines epidemiology estimates (provided by Chaelin Kim based on her work in this paper:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.08.22274821v2 & code in this repository : https://github.com/vaccine-impact/vaccine_amr ), with economic unit cost estimates (from https://github.com/NikkiR08/AMR-UCR). Inflation and exchange rate data are used to preserve local currency units and local economic shifts throughout, where possible. All cost results are then presented in 2019 USD.

Follow the numerical order of the scripts, starting with those in the "1_creating_DRI_estimates" subfolder, then following from "1a_sampling...".
